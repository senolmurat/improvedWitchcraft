### Overview

Ever felt that the Grand Rite was a bit dull and boring? The Improved Witchcraft mod unlocks the true potential of witchcraft, transforming the Grand Rite from a simple activity into an expanded experience. Perform focused rites with new intents, from seeking boons to unleashing curses.

### Features

- **Three new Grand Rite intents**: "Seek Blessing", "Hex Enemy", and "Seek Forbidden Knowledge".
- **Added activity options**: Choose extravagance from humble and secret to grand and public; affects guest opinion gain and your stress loss.
- **New flavorful events**: Narrative chains per intent with empowering or risky outcomes.
- **Unique character modifiers & boons**: Temporary bonuses and long-lasting boons tied to ritual outcomes.
- **Leveled Witch trait**: Progress from Witch → Adept → Master with stronger effects.
- **2 new cultural traditions**: Occult Practices, Folk Healers.
- **New court position**: [Court Alchemist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3548614933) — thanks to [Ledmano](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097768858) for integration.
- **Court position mod integration**: Designed alongside my [Court Herbalist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3571752592) mod.
- **7 language support**.

### Intents

- **Seek Blessing**: Gain random powerful boons (replaces perk points). The boon’s related skill is chosen similarly to the vanilla grand rite.
- **Hex Enemy**: Target rivals or murder targets with curses and condemnations. Targets can gain negative modifiers or traits; experienced witches may even bring plague to a rival’s lands.
- **Seek Forbidden Knowledge**: Gain lifestyle perk points from your chosen lifestyles. Risky and stressful—requires learning and luck; alternatively take safer lifestyle experience without the risks.

### Traditions

#### Occult Practices
"Views on magic as a discipline rooted in esoteric knowledge. Its followers believe that through the careful application of rituals, symbols, and incantations found in forbidden lore, one can command the unseen forces of the world. Power is not given, but seized through understanding."

- Witch trait is prestigious and grants monthly prestige.
- Hosting a grand rite rewards prestige.
- Converting characters of this culture to witch is easier.
- Grand Rite cooldown reduced by 1 year.

#### Folk Healers
"There are those who believe that true healing comes from the union of earth and spirit. Knowledge of herbs mends the flesh, but only the wisdom of the old ways can soothe a troubled soul or ward off unseen blights. Their most respected healers are therefore those who walk both paths, blending practical medicine with the deeper magic of the natural world."

- Can appoint Court Alchemist.
- Can appoint Court Herbalist (only when the [Court Herbalist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3571752592) mod is enabled).
- Can gain Wise Man trait from attending a grand rite.
- Herbalist trait is easier to gain at rites (player-favored odds; +20% chance in event).
- Court Physicians cost slightly less to hire.

### Tenets

**Coven Worship**

Note: For compatibility, the tenet addition is a separate submod (tenets require overriding the full file). Get it here: [Improved Witchcraft – Tenet Submod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3566658247).

"True power is not found in solitude, but in the shared will of the coven. We believe that our strength is magnified when we gather, and our most sacred rites bind us together as a spiritual family."

- Hosting a grand rite rewards piety.
- Grand Rite cooldown reduced by 1 year.
- Same Faith opinion +5.
- Different Faith opinion -5.
- Learning +1.

Overrides file (in submod):

- `common/religion/doctrines/00_core_tenets.txt`

### Inspiration

The coven system is fun, but grand rites can become repetitive. This mod adds variety and meaningful choices with risks and rewards, until official content expands witchcraft further.

### Notes

While tested, there may be balancing issues or minor bugs. I plan to add more intents, events, options, and possibly coven-related decisions in the future (no promises). Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

Court Herbalist is not required, but it pairs well and is designed alongside Improved Witchcraft.

### Compatibility

Save-game compatible, but a **new game is recommended** for compatibility, especially with Court Herbalist.
