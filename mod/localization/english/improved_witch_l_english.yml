The script shifts when you are not looking, and in the corners of your sight you glimpse truths not meant for mortal minds.\n\nEvery instinct tells you to shut it, to consign it back to dust and darkness. Yet the pull is irresistible. With each page turned, you feel power unfurling — a clarity that promises mastery over your chosen path.\n\nBut there is danger. To delve too deep is to invite corruption, to let something alien coil itself into your soul. The price may be sanity, health, or worse.You could restrain yourself, gleaning only fragments of wisdom — safe, but far less rewarding. Or… you could surrender to the abyss, and see what secrets it yields."
